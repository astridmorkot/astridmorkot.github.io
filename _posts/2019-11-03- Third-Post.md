Bad Seed 


Red plant-pots on kitchen shelves, 

evenly spaced, a perfect crimson space 

for her love to bloom.

March flowers overhead, and with it,

green roots, little vines of love, 

tangling themselves around her heart.

Small hands with good intentions, 

over time, winding themselves around her neck.


Daylight cripples and her plants curl up beside her,

bodies twisting into each other, one flesh.

My voice cries out for her, *Mother Make Me A Big Tall Tree!*
But she is transfixed, by the sun and the moon with their halcyon rays

and promises of changed life. 

Eden’s strange daughter, I her bad seed.

Feel Free


I entered this world as a screeching red comet, 

you my whetstone, with your straight face and sharp edges,

kindly filing me into shape. 

Eventually, I began to sharpen myself against you.

The shrieking and shouting, soft cries, defining moments.

Hard blows of lost adolescence dawning on me. 

Conversations with no destinations, 

and even though I’m bleeding, I still love you. 


Now I am grown, 

and every stone in this city reminds me of you,

At night I toss and turn, my stomach a peach-pit of loneliness

growing violently, threatening to undo me. 

But, I finally understand that we wax and wane on the same plane.

It is only now I have realised that the world is standing still.
