title: Women In Trees 
---
![group photo](/images/mkj.jpeg)

I found this picture of a Danish girl on a photography website one of my Art History tutors told me about. It reminded me a lot of Han Kang's *The Vegetarian* which I recently read for my creative writing class at univeristy. I'll probably have to dedicate another post just to *The Vegetarian*, as it was probably the most beautiful and rich novella I've ever encountererd. I love it so much I'm thinking about writing my dissertation about metamorphoses of the female form, particuarly that which transcends the human into nature. I want to look at the instances in which women have morphed into trees in literature- of course Ovid's Daphne is going to be a main subject. 
Anyway, for my creative writing class we were asked to respond to Han Kang's novella in a creative form. I chose a few. I thought maybe I could experiment with them right here. 


*My Mother The Tree*


My Mother Turned Into A Tree, 

In December, 

Leaves Sprang From Her Hands, 

And With Every Inhale Greed Whisked Her Away,

Each Breath Sweeter Than The Last,

She Grew Into The Earth And Away From Me, 

And Her Eyes Wept Green Sap, 

Of Joy And Freedom And Everything Else. 

I Blame The Seasons,

For Transfixing Her, 

With Its Halcyon Rays And Promises 

Of Changed Life,

Implanting Her Like The Seed From Whence She Grew. 

At Night I Still Cry Out For Her, 

To Be Tangled In Her Flesh, 

Under The Earth With Her,

Fresh Mud On My Tongue,

And Dirt In My Lungs,

But,

She Returns To Her Soil, 

Eden’s Daughter, 

And I To Mine.

*Self Ablaze*


Clara stepped into a doorframe, immediately slashing the warm Viennese sunlight in two. Remaining fragments of light angled around her, piercing the gaps in her dark fringe. Her slender frame cast a sinister shadow upwards, curving around the steep museum wall and back down on her. Clara’s feet occupied little space on the alternating grey / white marble tiles. She stood, planted, glancing up at her new surroundings. Large windows ballooned overhead, which the fading day seeped through in blocks of pale light. Heaven! In this very city where Freud and Trotsky clinked coffee mugs under Empress Elisabeth’s oppressive gaze. These very halls Franz Ferdinand had skulked along. Reproachful finger poised in moustache. Clara’s lips twitched, soaking in the history. 

Her cold fingers were intertwined in the grip of her small daughter. Anna, her strange child, more nymph than girl, with her long silky curls that tumbled to her waist and her soft pearly skin. Her features were extremely forgiving, a tiny waif in her mother’s large shadow. Clara on the other hand shifted rooms with her appearance. Her nose was thin and sharp, high arching cheekbones bloomed from her face. Her eyes were perfect almonds, indigo and violent in pigment. This face was framed by strands of rich ebony hair. Everything had been deliberately placed, purposefully crafted-  like she had danced right out of one of Gustav Klimt’s paintings. Perhaps people thought she was part of the exhibition! The only relics small Anna had inherited from Clara was her shared love for art and silence. 

Adjacent to this scene, visitors drifted in and out of the main room and descended down a beautifully carved marble staircase that trapped golden rays and bounced them around the space in dazzling cubes of light, shining so zealously they appeared wet. No famous Belvedere Museum queue reproached them. Their timing was impeccable. After a few dull moments of gallery practicalities, (fumbling for cash, smiling at guards, tickets, don’t forget to smile!), the pair were at the mercy of the main event: Gustav Klimt in all his glory, crystallised and set in gold for all of eternity. The nakedness of Klimt’s gorgeous women, caked in their abstract colours with their distorted limbs and golden tears surrounded the unusual two. Camera’s glumly obeyed the red sign to the left of Clara.

The attentive sounds of shutters clicking invisibly echoed around the room. Camera-less
Clara marvelled over Judith and the Head of Holofernes, with her red cheeks and ruffled hair, charcoal like her own. She craned her neck to meet her gaze and parted her lips, briefly mimicking her expression, one marked with a poise Clara found strangely erotic. Judith was obviously mindful of her own beauty, the liquid gold muse of Klimt’s imagination. She had already been subject to the academic gaze in one of Clara’s Art History classes. But up close, she was oddly menacing. Judith’s eyes twitched uncomfortably, following Clara’s. She stood uneasily, suddenly burdened and heavy, fearful to break this peculiar visual exchange. In the painting’s reflection, Clara noticed a familiar sight. Anna’s small silhouette was cutting its way diagonally across the scene. Too young to abide by public gallery etiquette, she had been drawn to something interesting. Clara spun around, leaving Judith and Adele Bloch-Bauer to their own devices.

Anna stood beneath Tannenwald I, which at first glance, depicted a fiery but bleak image of winter. Tall, slender trees arched high, layering on top of one another in varying warm shades. Thick splats of green paint, moss, clung to the forefront pines and slowly spread outwards. Dark spaces filled the gaps between trees, leaving behind the bold outlines of colourful branches, and protruding, fallen leaves. A clearing presented itself, luscious and green, gently refracting the felicitations of light that poured through the trees from an absent sun. 

Clara stepped closer. The invisible line of string between her and canvas gawked. Behind the glass, something twitched. A small amber leaf drifted down from a pine-tree. Could it be? Clara blinked rapidly, starring furiously at the painting. At first, a blot, then, a shape emerged in front of her eyes. Dark shapes morphed into sharp shoulder-blades, leaves transformed into collarbones. Then, a face, petite and spiky, poked out from being a branch, making itself known to its viewer. Her skin was hard and tacky, coated with thick bark and mud. Clara tilted her head at the frame, which the figure instantaneously mirrored. Her eyes were deep-set, cut with harsh labradorite rock; flickers of blue danced in them for a moment, twirling around her corneas like ice-skaters on a tranquil winter’s lake, and fell. As Clara moved forward and backward, testing new boundaries, Tannenwald’s tree-woman followed, daring to snatch a glimpse of the now empty Belvedere museum. Elated with unnerving desire; her eyelashes beat in synchronisation with Clara’s: Tempting her? Willing her? In the corner of the painting, flickers of warm light charred at the canvas, as if Klimt were here himself, painting some drama into the frame. 

A tree fell. 

In the clearing, fragments of orange bark littered the earth. Clara leaned in once more, and gently lifted cool finger to warm glass. With ease, her finger penetrated its perimeter; she seized a burning leaf in her hand. Her eyes widened as it crumbled in her fist. “Fuck!” She exclaimed, quickly retracted her hand. Pain clung to her, fizzing and lingering on the tips of her fingers. One by one, as if in ordered procession, trees were engulfed by fire. Now in central focus, the woman stood, smugly smiling in the path of her earthly destruction. 

Clara was motionless, enamoured. In the gallery, the Water Serpents to the right of her danced in the bonfire.  Mother and Child clung to one another in their familiar pose, fighting the flames that now lifted them. In the distance, Judith raised an eyebrow- a feminine salute. Were they inspired? The hot air around them was intensifying. Glancing back, Clara’s admirer had vanished, lost to the burning sea behind the glass pane. Reflected flames tugged away at Anna’s pearly hair, and then at her own. 

A large weight thumped down on Clara’s back. Someone was seizing her. Firm hands struck her bony shoulders. In a single motion, her knees had caved beneath her. Clara tasted the fumes around her, hot and sticky like smoked honey. Dizziness triumphed; her feet were now in a tangled heap in front of her. Hard marble tiles caressed her aching forehead; the sweet stench of burning canvas filled her lungs. Clara lay, momentarily blurred by the calamity of it all, gazing up at the glaciated ceilings, marbled with their intricate patterns and designs. Where is Anna? A brief thought, quickly replaced with heavier, scarier ones. Nothing mattered anymore. Nothing would exist for Clara beyond these gold walls ablaze. 

She looked down at her hand: held in her tight grip lay a green lighter.
